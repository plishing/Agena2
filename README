##########################

This software was built by Christian Mass-Protzen in order to control the AGENA high altitude probe. It mainly evolves around the main process main.py controlling the processes of getting GPS data and sensor data, parsing them into a suitable string and to send that by radio into the ether.

Main computer:
Raspberry Pi 2 B
Sensors:
DHT22
HMC553L
MS5611
DS180B

GPS
uBLOX MAX M8

Transmiiter
NTX2B FA
 

The software was made only for Agena and I'm pretty sure that it can be improved ;) The software is released under the BeerWare license which pretty much means that you may use, copy and ammend this software - or parts of it - for your own purposes. 

I hope it's useful for any co-HAB'ers.
